Terran API
==========


Summary
-------

A library for editing and creating content for [Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/331970/Disneys_Treasure_Planet_Battle_of_Procyon/), loosely inspired by the first [map editor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/35u3zd34ju6oinw/Map%20Editor.zip), originally developed by [Electrolysing](https://www.youtube.com/@Electrolysing).

If you are specifically looking for a modern graphical map editor, take a look at the [TPMapEditor](https://github.com/Randhomme/TPMapEditor) by Randhomme.

Furthermore, if you are interested in mods, lore and other projects related to the game, be sure to check out the [Etherium Forces Discord server](https://discord.gg/drQNME8)!


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Terran-Map-Editor/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
